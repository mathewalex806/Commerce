## Commerce
Commerce is an e-commerce auction site that allows users to buy and sell items online. Users can create auction listings for their products, set a starting price and a deadline. Other users can browse the listings and place bids on the items they want to buy. The highest bidder at the end of the auction wins the item. Users can also leave comments on the listings to ask questions or give feedback. Additionally, users can add listings to their watchlist to keep track of their favorite items.

Built using Django - a Python web framework and HTML.
